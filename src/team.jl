                I began my studies in Cognitive Science at the University of Osnabr√ºck in 2010, with a focus on computer vision and machine learning.
                In search of a language that could deliver superior performance for interactive computer vision and GPU computing, along with a mathematically elegant alternative to OOP,
                I discovered Julia in 2012. It's been my language of choice ever since.
                Working with C++ on machine learning projects in 2011, I experienced a lack of interactive tools for data visualization and model parameter manipulation.
                This led to my Bachelor's thesis, where I developed a Makie predecessor - containing code that is still utilized in Makie today.
                Since then, I've contributed significantly to the development of Julia's graphic, GPU, and plotting infrastructure, and authored numerous related packages:""",
