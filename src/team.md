    I've started using Julia in 2018 to write a Monte-Carlo simulation for my Bachelor thesis in condensed matter physics. The project continued afterwards with code running on our HPC cluster, resulting in two papers. Since then I have continued working with Julia and contributed to various open source projects.

    Packages I (co-)authored include:
    https://github.com/ffreyer/SphereSurfaceHistogram.jl
    https://github.com/carstenbauer/BinningAnalysis.jl
    https://github.com/carstenbauer/MonteCarlo.jl
    https://github.com/ffreyer/LatPhysPlottingMakie.jl

    And packages I contributed to mainly include the Makie ecosystem, especially Makie itself.
    https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl
    https://github.com/fatteneder/MakieSlides.jl
    https://github.com/JuliaPlots/MakieTeX.jl
    https://github.com/JuliaIO/MeshIO.jl
    https://github.com/JuliaGizmos/Observables.jl (indirectly)
    https://github.com/JuliaGeometry/GeometryBasics.jl


    I am well experienced with the Makie ecosystem, including the internals of GLMakie, CairoMakie and Makie. I have contributed to many of the core components, such as for example the event system, rendering of meshes in CairoMakie or line rendering in GLMakie. From University I have experience in physics, teaching, HPC, performance optimization, linear algebra and float precision problems.
