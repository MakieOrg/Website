## [Multibody.jl](https://help.juliahub.com/multibody/dev/#Multibody)

Multibody.jl is a library of model components for ModelingToolkit, an equation-based modeling language. With Multibody.jl, the user can assemble dynamical models for simulation of mechanical systems, such as robots, cars, drive lines and aircraft, by connecting ready-made components such as rods, boxes, joints and wheels. 
The modeling-language is responsible for deriving the equations of motion of the assembled model, lifting this burden off the shoulders of the modeler. 3D mechanical modeling benefits greatly from being able to visualize the mechanical system, both during the model-building process and while analyzing the result of a simulation. The interactive features of Makie fits this bill perfectly, allowing the user to produce both animations and interactive renders of their model.

## [GraphPlayground.jl](https://github.com/dgleich/GraphPlayground.jl)

Sometimes the best way to understand data is to play around with it interactively. There is a lovely package in JavaScript to do this by Mike Bostock called d3. In particular, the d3-force library includes all sorts of fun demos. GraphPlayground.jl includes a port of the d3-force library to Julia to enable an interactive graph exploration tool in Makie (via GraphMakie.jl). It's capable of force calculations (attractions, repulsions, collisions) with tens of thousands of simple objects. I've used it to explore graphs of session conflicts at conferences as well as to generate layouts for small graphs. Given any undirected graph from Graphs.jl, using it is as simple as playground(g) to get an interactive window with labels, the ability to pin nodes, and the ability to export coordinates of the final layout.
